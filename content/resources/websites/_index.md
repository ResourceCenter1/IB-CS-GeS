# Websites
Sharing knowledge is a weirdly fullfilling exercise that appeals many people. These people creates invaluable content that helps other to learn even the most difficult material. Therefore, we are happy to gather all such content in one convenient place.

# Conent overview:
- [IB ComSci Hub](#ib-comsci-hub)
- [Wikibooks/Computer Science](#wikibookscomputer-science)
- [Mr. Wachs' Classes…](#mr-wachs-classes)
- [GeeksForGeeks](#geeksforgeeks)

## IB ComSci Hub
**Description:** [IB ComSci Hub](https://ib.compscihub.net) is entirely dedicated to IBDP Computer Science course and is very popular among IBDP community. You can find there not only the overview of the course, but also useful materials for studying topics, options and tips for Extended Essay in CS. You should definately chech it out!

## Wikibooks/Computer Science
**Description:** [Wikibooks](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Main_Page) is a general-knowledge repositorium, however, it has a [strong section](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/IB/Group_4/Computer_Science) devoted to the IBDP CS course. The whole course is divided into well-structured and easily managable pieces, which helps with revisions.

It does **not** cover Modelling and Simulation option.

## Mr. Wachs' Classes…
**Description:** [Mr. Wachs' Classes…](https://mrwachs.wordpress.com) is a website run by an enthusiastic CS teacher, Lawrence Wachs. You can find there **A LOT** of content, concerning stricte CS and everything around and more. Of particular interest is ["Courses" tab](https://mrwachs.wordpress.com/current-classes/) which contains resources for studying CS in general and specifically to the IBDP CS course. He also has an accompanying [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@MrWachs). Waste time no more and go search it!

## GeeksForGeeks
**Description:** [GeeksForGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org) is like a Wikipedia, but for CS and prettier. What I mean is everyone can contribute. Anyway, there are many useful articles about almost any topic. It is not dedicated to IBDP though, so it may not overlap with the curriculum. However, it is still a very interesting place to visit.
