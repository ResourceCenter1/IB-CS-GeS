# Youtube resources
Some people find video materials more enganging and prefer to learn from them. This page provides a list of worth-considering youtube channels.

## Content overview:
- [Computer science](#computer-science)
- [Computerphile](#computerphile)
- [Ben Eater](#ben-eater)
- [CrashCourse/computer science](#crashcoursecomputer-science)
- [freeCodeCamp.org](#freecodecamporg)

## Computer science
**Description:**
Literally [_Computer science_](https://www.youtube.com/c/ComputerScienceLessons/videos) is focused on explaining theoretical concepts as well as providing some practical tutorials. The topic of each video is very specific, coherent, and cohesive. Furthermore, I beliece that the knowledge presented is almost identical to knowledge required by IB.

{{< hint danger >}}
The only disadvantage I can think of is that it doesn't cover `Modelling and simulation` option.

**Example video:**

**Topics:** `System fundamentals`, `Computer organization`, `Networks`, `Computational thinking`, `Abstract data structures`, `Resource management`, `Control`
<br>
**Options:** `Databases`, `Web science`, `OOP`

## Computerphile
**Description:**
[_Computerphile_](https://www.youtube.com/user/Computerphile/videos) is a very well-known and extremely comprehensive channel. The explanation is always clear and undoubtedly facilitates the understanding of a viewer. If there's a big topic, it is broken into easly consumable pieces in form of playlists.

{{< hint danger >}}
However, the explanation is so in-depth it may be overwhelming for some people. Also, contary to the previous channel, it is not possible to choose a specific topic/concept from the syllabus, add "computerphile" and get the exact explanation. **To understand the topic, is it necessary to watch the whole video.**

**Topics:** `System fundamentals`, `Computer organization`, `Networks`, `Computational thinking`, `Abstract data structures`, `Resource management`, `Control`
<br>
**Options:** `Databases`, `Modelling and simulation`, `Web science`, `OOP`


## Ben Eater
**Description:**
[_Ben Eater_](https://www.youtube.com/c/BenEater) is rather a hardware-oriented channel. The inner working of a computer is covered in full: from electricity, trough bites and processor, to making one's own GPU. Nevertheless, low-level technologies such as assembly and C are also discussed. Admittedly, it is done in respect to the computer (how it interpretes machine code etc.), but still it is.

{{< hint danger >}}
As mentioned, this channel is very hardware-oriented so there's slim to none of e.g. computational thinking. Furthermore, most of the content is so thorough, it is far beyond the scope of IBDP.

**Topics:** `Computer organization`, `Networks`, `Resource management`, `Control`

**Options:** -

## CrashCourse/computer science
**Description:**
[CrashCourse](https://www.youtube.com/c/crashcourse) is a "general-purpose" channel with the variety of courses on different subjects. Of interest here, however, is the **[computer science](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpIctyqH29Q&list=PL8dPuuaLjXtNlUrzyH5r6jN9ulIgZBpdo)** playlist. This playlist features brief and coherent videos on computer science. It serves as a good, in-a-nutshell intro to computer science. Besides, the graphics are magnificent!

{{< hint danger >}}
Although the channel may nicely introduce a viewer to a big picture in short time, it does not cover the material in a sufficient way. Thus, this should be facilitated other resources.

**Example video:**
{{< youtube DuDz6B4cqVc >}}

**Topics:** `System fundamentals`, `Networks`, `Abstract data structures`, `Resource management`
<br>
**Options:** `Databases`, `Web science`

## freeCodeCamp.org
**Description:**
[freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.youtube.com/c/Freecodecamp/videos) focuses on learn-by-yourself content, however, it is useful in the context of IBDP. Explanation of much of the syllabus can be found here. Videos are prepared for both beginners and intermediate (those with some prior knowledge).

{{< hint danger >}}
Nonetheless, videos are very extensive and thus may be considered exhausting. Some clips last an hour, two or more. Is is hard to "distill" important information. Also, the quality of certain videos (in terms of the delivery of content) is questionable.
