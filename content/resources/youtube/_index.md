## Computer science
**Description:**
Literally [Computer science](https://www.youtube.com/c/ComputerScienceLessons/videos) is a youtube channel focused on, well, computer science. It explains theoretical concepts as well as provide some practical tutorials. The topic of each video is very specific and coherent. Furthermore, I beleive that the knowledge presented is almost identical to knowledge required by IB (up to this moment).
