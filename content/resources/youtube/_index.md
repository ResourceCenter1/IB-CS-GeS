# Youtube resources
Some people find video materials more enganging and prefer to learn from them. This page provides a list of worth-considering youtube channels.

## Content overview:
- [Computer science](#computer-science)

## Computer science
**Description:**
Literally [_Computer science_](https://www.youtube.com/c/ComputerScienceLessons/videos) is focused on explaining theoretical concepts as well as providing some practical tutorials. The topic of each video is very specific, coherent, and cohesive. Furthermore, I beliece that the knowledge presented is almost identical to knowledge required by IB.

The only disadvantage I can think of is that it doesn't cover `Modelling and simulation` option.

**Example video:**

**Topics:** `System fundamentals`, `Computer organization`, `Networks`, `Computational thinking`, `Abstract data structures`, `Resource management`, `Control`
<br>
**Options:** `Databases`, `Web science`, `OOP`
