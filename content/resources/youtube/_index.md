# Youtube resources
Some people find video materials more enganging and prefer to learn from them. This page provides a list of worth-considering youtube channels.

## Content overview:
- [Computer science](#computer-science)
- [Computerphile](#computerphile)
- [Ben Eater](#ben-eater)

## Computer science
**Description:**
Literally [_Computer science_](https://www.youtube.com/c/ComputerScienceLessons/videos) is focused on explaining theoretical concepts as well as providing some practical tutorials. The topic of each video is very specific, coherent, and cohesive. Furthermore, I beliece that the knowledge presented is almost identical to knowledge required by IB.

**Possible flaw:**
The only disadvantage I can think of is that it doesn't cover `Modelling and simulation` option.

**Example video:**

**Topics:** `System fundamentals`, `Computer organization`, `Networks`, `Computational thinking`, `Abstract data structures`, `Resource management`, `Control`
<br>
**Options:** `Databases`, `Web science`, `OOP`

## Computerphile
**Description:**
[_Computerphile_](https://www.youtube.com/user/Computerphile/videos) is a very well-known and extremely comprehensive channel. The explanation is always clear and undoubtedly facilitates the understanding of a viewer. If there's a big topic, it is broken into easly consumable pieces in form of playlists.

**Possible flaws:**
However, the explanation is so in-depth it may be overwhelming for some people. Also, contary to the previous channel, it is not possible to choose a specific topic/concept from the syllabus, add "computerphile" and get the exact explanation. **To understand the topic, is it necessary to watch the whole video.**

**Example video:**
{{< youtube UvI-AMAtrvE >}}

**Topics:** `System fundamentals`, `Computer organization`, `Networks`, `Computational thinking`, `Abstract data structures`, `Resource management`, `Control`
<br>
**Options:** `Databases`, `Modelling and simulation`, `Web science`, `OOP`
