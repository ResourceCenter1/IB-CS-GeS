| Subject          | SL | HL |
| ---------------- | -- | -- |
| Computer science | 72 | 69 |
| Chemistry (TZ1)  | 78 | 79 |
| Physics (TZ1)    | 65 | 67 |
| Biology (TZ1)    | 79 | 78 |
| Economics (TZ1)  | 75 | 71 |
| English B        | 87 | 87 |

## Standard level (SL)

{{< hint info >}}
**How to calculate the final result for SL?**  
You can calculate your final result using the following formula:  

{{< katex display  >}}
45\cdot\frac{\text{[P1]}}{70} + 25\cdot\frac{\text{[P2]}}{45} + 30\cdot\frac{\text{[IA]}}{34}
{{< /katex >}}
where
* [P1] is the number of marks you got for Paper 1 (max 70)
* [P2] is the number of marks you got for Paper 2 (max 45)
* [IA] is the number of marks you got for the solution of the Internal Assessment (max 34)
{{< /hint >}}

{{< hint warning >}}
Before May 2016, the maximum number of marks for the Internal Assessment was 40. This is because the Group 4 Project was evaluated and marked up to 6 additional points.

{{< hint warning >}}
Paper 2 was removed from the May 2021 session due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For this reason, Paper 1 had a weight of 70 (instead of 45).

{{< hint info >}}
**How to calculate the final result for HL?**  
You can calculate your final result using the following formula:  

{{< katex display  >}}
40\cdot\frac{\text{[P1]}}{100} + 20\cdot\frac{\text{[P2]}}{65} + 20\cdot\frac{\text{[P3]}}{30} + 20\cdot\frac{\text{[IA]}}{34}
{{< /katex >}}
where
* [P1] is the number of marks you got for Paper 1 (max 100)
* [P2] is the number of marks you got for Paper 2 (max 65)
* [P2] is the number of marks you got for Paper 3 (max 30)
* [IA] is the number of marks you got for the solution of the Internal Assessment (max 34)
