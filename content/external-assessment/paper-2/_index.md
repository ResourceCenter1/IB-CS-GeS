* Option A: Databases

The maximum number of marks you can get for Paper 2 depends on the chosen level (45 or 65). Your Paper 2 score translates into 20-25% of your final grade, see [grade boundaries]({{< ref "/general-information/grade-boundaries" >}}).

## Grade boundaries

Computer science course has a variety of assessment components. Paper 2 is marked using markschemes and assigned a numerical mark by the external examiner. Grade boundaries are then applied to determine the overall grade on the 1-7 scale for this component.

These boundaries have no impact on your final grade. However, they may be used to estimate the difficulty of the component.
