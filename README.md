# Computer Science Resource Center
This resource center was initially meant to enhance the communication between the computer science teacher and students at [Gaudium et Studium](https://www.liceum.eduges.pl). However, it has become a general platform that gathers useful resources for studying [Computer Science in IBDP](https://www.ibo.org/programmes/diploma-programme/curriculum/sciences/computer-science/).
